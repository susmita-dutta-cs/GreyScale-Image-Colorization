The main objective of this project was to automate colorization of grayscale images using deep convolutional networks by training them on a set of images. Convolutional neural networks, as a sub-topic of machine learning algorithms garnered popularity as a representative issue for complete visual understanding of artificial intelligence, Previously this was recognised as object recognition because to achieve a colorized targeted image the method needs to process a series of sub tasks similar to segmentation classification and localization.In this project referring to Zhang et al research work on this topic CIE lab color space was used for the transformtion.
